Whole script is based on https://gist.github.com/svbergerem/5914d7f87764901aefddba125af99938. The only diffrence is that my script saves data to json and u can send it to another nextcloud instance whenever you want to, base script transfers deck between nextcloud instances.

I am not using `send` mode regurarly so there is no guarantee that its still working but last nextcloud version I tested that with is `25.0.1`

# üõ† Testing

If u want to test if it works u can run docker and test it with default values

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d

# create nextcloud user if it was run for the first time
$ python main.py # to download created decks from localhost
Progress |################################| 19/19

$ python main.py --mode send # to send data saved in file nextcloud-decks.json to localhost
Progress |################################| 19/19
```

# üì∫ Makefile

-   `make init` - install requierments (only needed to pack script to single file if u dont want this u dont have to do this)
-   `make build` - pack python scripts to single file
-   `make install` - copy built file to `~/.local/bin/` as `nextcloud-deck-backuper`
-   `make clean` - delete build and build artifacts from root project directory

# üìù To do

-   [ ] Possibility to provide `.pem` file for self signed certificates
-   [x] Add progress bar
